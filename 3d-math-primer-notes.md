This page will display the notes that I took while reading the book [*3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development*](https://gamemath.com/) by 
Fletcher Dunn and Ian Parbery.
I am reading this book to learn the mathematical concepts behind 2D and 3D objects in games, namely their positions, orientations, trajectories, and more. With this, I hope to demonstrate 3D vector math knowledge to future employers.

# [**Introduction**](https://gamemath.com/book/intro.html) 
This section gave me a very good overview of the book as a whole. I am very excited to be reading about many different areas of mathematics such as trigonometry, linear algebra, and calculus. I have experience with all of these topics from my undergraduate education, but I am excited to learn how it is put into practice!
